Collaborative Project Management System

A modern collaborative project management platform inspired by tools like Jira, built with a production-oriented architecture and modern full-stack technologies. The project focuses on scalable backend architecture, authentication, authorization, and collaborative workflows rather than being a simple CRUD application.
